    <h1>Get to know Ubong</h1>
    <h2>My name is Ubong Obot and I'm a Backend Engineering student with AltSchool Africa. My student ID is: <em>ALT/SOE/025/5597</em>. For a long time, I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to become. I just knew I enjoyed working with computers and the internet. I would spend hours exploring websites, curious about how they worked. At first, it all seemed like magic, clicking a button and seeing something happen, filling out a form and getting a response. I didn’t understand how these worked, but I was drawn to them.</h2>
    
    <h2>
        Eventually, I discovered WordPress. It was my entry point into the world of web development. At first, it was just about learning how to put together simple websites, using themes, plugins, and basic customization. But the more I did, the more I realized there was a whole world behind what users see on the screen. I started asking questions: What happens when someone logs in? Where is the data stored? How do these systems talk to each other? That’s when I learned about backend development, and everything began to make sense.
    </h2>
    
    <h2>Though I’m still early in my journey, I’ve found something I’m genuinely passionate about. I want to understand the logic behind the web, how servers respond to requests, how databases store information, and how APIs connect different parts of an application. I want to go from being someone who only builds with tools to someone who can build the tools themselves.</h2> 
    <h2>
        But I know that passion alone isn’t enough; I need guidance, structure, and a learning environment that can help me grow. That’s why I joined this program. This program is a door to opportunity. It will give me access to proper training, practical projects, and industry insights that I wouldn’t otherwise have. It will help me build real skills through real-world experience, something I believe is essential to becoming a great backend developer.
