            <h1>About Ubong</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Ubong Obot and I'm a Backend Engineering student with AltSchool Africa. My student ID is: <strong>ALT/SOE/025/5597</strong>. For a long time, I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to become. I just knew I enjoyed working with computers and the internet. I would spend hours exploring websites, curious about how they worked. At first, it all seemed like magic, clicking a button and seeing something happen, filling out a form and getting a response. I didn’t understand how these worked, but I was drawn to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, I discovered WordPress. It was my entry point into the world of web development. At first, it was just about learning how to put together simple websites, using themes, plugins, and basic customization. But the more I did, the more I realized there was a whole world behind what users see on the screen. I started asking questions: What happens when someone logs in? Where is the data stored? How do these systems talk to each other? That’s when I learned about backend development, and everything began to make sense.

            <p>
                Though I’m still early in my journey, I’ve found something I’m genuinely passionate about. I want to understand the logic behind the web, how servers respond to requests, how databases store information, and how APIs connect different parts of an application. I want to go from being someone who only builds with tools to someone who can build the tools themselves.

            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                When I am not working, writing code or learning new things, I like to relax and have fun. I do this in a lot of ways and I will be listing them below.
                <br>
                Below are a list of some of my hobbies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traveling</li>
                <li>Cooking</li>
                <li>Listening to lyrically sound music</li>
                <li>Watching Movies</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Listening to lyrically sound music: </strong> Music are heavily therapeutic to me, so, I don't listen to junk, hence the caption. 
                <br>
                <strong>Watching Movies: </strong> This is one of the ways I relax after a long day of work or after been stressed. 
            </p>

            <h2>My Aspirations</h2>

            <p>
                I've got lots of aspirations, spanning from my career in tech to my personal life. However, I will be focusing on my career aspirations for now, especially in the tech space.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the next 5 years, I see myself as a proficient backend developer, building complex, reliable, secure and efficient systems. I would have built my career to the point where I would have worked with international and local companies, helping them solve complex issues.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I also would be a mentor to so many looking to come into tech, begin or wanting to pivot their career in tech.
